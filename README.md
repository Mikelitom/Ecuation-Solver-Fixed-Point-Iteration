# Ecuation-Solver-Fixed-Point-Iteration
Creating a method to solve ecuation´s roots by fixed point iteration

While I was in class today, my teacher show us this method to find an ecuation´s root by fixed point, after the class ended he told us that this method was
usually used on programs created by software engineers, so I started to think how could I aply this to a program
